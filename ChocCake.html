	<h2>Required Ingredients</h2>
	
	<li>250g/8½oz butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
	<li>400g/14oz golden caster sugar</li>
	<li>3 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
	<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>3 free-range eggs, beaten</li>
	<li>400g/14oz plain flour</li>
	<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>½ tsp salt</li>
	<li>pinch cinnamon</li>
	<li>85g/3oz cocoa powder</li>
	
	<h2>Method</h2>
	
	<li>Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3.</li>
	<li>Grease a 25cm/10in cake tin with butter and line with greaseproof paper.</li>
	<li>For the chocolate cake, in a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is pale and light.</li>
	<li>In a separate bowl, stir the sunflower oil and vanilla extract into the beaten eggs.</li>
	<li>Gradually beat the egg mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, adding only a little egg mixture at a time 
	and making sure it is well incorporated before adding more, until all of the egg mixture has been incorporated and the mixture is well combined.</li>
	<li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and cocoa powder until well combined.</li>
	<li>Gradually fold the flour mixture to the cake batter mixture, a spoonful at a time, until all of the flour mixture has been incorporated into the cake batter.</li>
	<li>Pour the cake batter into the greased, lined cake tin. Level the top of the cake out with a palette knife or spatula.</li>
	<li>Transfer the cake to the oven and bake for 1hr 15 mins to 1hr 20 mins, checking regularly, or until the cake has risen and a skewer comes out clean when inserted 
	into the centre of the cake. (If the top of the cake browns too quickly during cooking, cover it with a sheet of aluminium foil.)</li>
	<li>Carefully remove the cake from its tin and set aside on a wire rack to cool.</li>
	<li>When the cake has cooled, cut the cake in half horizontally to create two thinner cakes.</li>
	<li>Spread your favourite filling in the middle. Place the second cake on top to create a sponge sandwich and top with frosting and/or your preferred toppings!</li>
